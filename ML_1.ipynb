    "Q1) Explain the following with an example\n",
    "1) Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "2) Machine Learning\n",
    "3) Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : \n",
    "1) Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes things like recognizing speech, making decisions, and solving problems. AI can be categorized into two types: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and general or strong AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One example of narrow AI is the voice assistant Siri, which can recognize and respond to voice commands. Another example of general AI is hypothetical robot that can think and perform tasks in the same way as a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that involves the development of algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. ML models are trained on data and use statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships that can be used to make predictions or take actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One example of machine learning is the use of algorithms to analyze customer data and make personalized product recommendations based on their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from large amounts of data. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process and learn from data, with each layer building upon the previous one to create increasingly complex representations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One example of deep learning is image recognition technology used in self-driving cars that is trained to recognize and identify different objects, such as other vehicles or pedestrians, based on vast amounts of image data."

    "Q3) What is unsupervised learning ? List some examples of unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, meaning that there is no pre-existing output data to guide the learning process. The algorithm is tasked with finding patterns and relationships within the input data without any specific target output in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of unsupervised learning is to identify the underlying structure of the data, such as groupings or clusters of similar data points, and extract useful insights from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of unsupervised learning include:\n",

    "Q5) What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : Supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning are the three main categories of machine learning. The main differences between them are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, which means that the output is known for each input data point. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs based on the labeled data. For example, a supervised learning algorithm can learn to predict the price of a house based on its features such as location, size, and number of rooms. The algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled house prices and features, and then it can predict the price of a new house based on its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, which means that there is no pre-existing output data to guide the learning process. The goal of unsupervised learning is to identify patterns and relationships within the input data without any specific target output in mind. For example, an unsupervised learning algorithm can identify clusters of customers based on their purchasing behavior, without any pre-existing knowledge of the customer groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning: Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. It involves training an algorithm on a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to leverage the unlabeled data to improve the accuracy of the model trained on the labeled data. For example, a semi-supervised learning algorithm can use a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to improve its accuracy in predicting the price of a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, supervised learning involves labeled data, unsupervised learning involves unlabeled data, and semi-supervised learning involves a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. The goal of each type of learning is different, and the algorithms used for each type of learning are also different."

    "Q6) What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : Train, test, and validation split is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. The dataset is split into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each subset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: The training set is used to train the model. This is where the model learns the patterns in the data and how to make predictions based on those patterns. The larger the training set, the better the model will perform, but a larger training set also means longer training times and more computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation set: The validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. Hyperparameters are settings that are set before the model is trained, such as learning rate or the number of hidden layers in a neural network. Tuning these hyperparameters is important to optimize the performance of the model. The validation set is used to test different hyperparameter values and select the best ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing set: The testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model. This is where the model is evaluated on data that it has not seen before. The testing set should be representative of the real-world data that the model will be applied to. If the model performs well on the testing set, it is likely to perform well on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of the train, test, and validation split is to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model memorizes the training set instead of learning the patterns in the data. This results in poor performance on new data. By splitting the data into three subsets, we can evaluate the performance of the model on new data and prevent overfitting by tuning the hyperparameters using the validation set."

    "Q7) How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying patterns and relationships in data without the need for labeled data. Anomalies or outliers are data points that do not conform to the expected patterns or behaviors in a dataset. Anomaly detection using unsupervised learning involves identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several unsupervised learning techniques that can be used for anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering: Clustering algorithms can group similar data points together and identify data points that do not belong to any cluster. These data points can be considered anomalies or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based methods: Density-based methods can identify regions of high density in the data and data points that are in low-density regions can be considered as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders: Autoencoders are neural networks that can learn to reconstruct input data. When an autoencoder is trained on normal data, it can identify anomalies by measuring the difference between the input and the reconstructed output. Anomalies are data points that cannot be reconstructed accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a technique that can be used to identify the most important features in a dataset. Anomalies can be identified by analyzing the features that contribute the most to the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, unsupervised learning can be used for anomaly detection by identifying patterns and relationships in data and identifying data points that do not conform to these patterns. This approach can be useful when labeled data is not available or when anomalies are rare and difficult to identify in a labeled dataset."
